/**
 * The {@code ComponentProperties} class contains the definitions of the properties associated with a component. These
 * definitions contain enough information to automatically construct a nice looking user interface (UI) to populate and
 * validate the properties. The objective is that no actual (graphical) UI code is included in the component's
 * definition and as well no custom graphical UI is required for most components. The types of UIs that can be defined
 * include those for desktop (Eclipse), web, and scripting. All of these will use the code defined here for their
 * construction and validation.
 * <p/>
 * All aspects of the properties are defined in a subclass of this class using the {@link Property},
 * {@Link PresentationItem}, {@link Widget}, and {@link Form} classes. In addition in cases where user interface
 * decisions are made in code, methods can be added to the subclass to influence the flow of the user interface and help
 * with validation.
 * <p/>
 * Each property can be a Java type, both simple types and collections are permitted. In addition,
 * {@code ComponentProperties} classes can be composed allowing hierarchies of properties and collections of properties
 * to be reused.
 * <p/>
 * A property is defined using a field in a subclass of this class. Each property field is initialized with one of the
 * following:
 * <ol>
 * <li>For a single property, a {@link Property} object, usually using a static method from the {@link PropertyFactory}.
 * </li>
 * <li>For a reference to other properties, a subclass of {@code ComponentProperties}.</li>
 * <li>For a presentation item that's not actually a property, but is necessary for the user interface, a
 * {@link PresentationItem}.</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p/>
 * For construction of user interfaces, properties are grouped into {@link Form} objects which can be presented in
 * various ways by the user interface (for example, a wizard page, a tab in a property sheet, or a dialog). The same
 * property can appear in multiple forms.
 * <p/>
 * Methods can be added in subclasses according to the conventions below to help direct the UI. These methods will be
 * automatically called by the UI code.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code before&lt;PropertyName&gt;} - Called before the property is presented in the UI. This can be used to
 * compute anything required to display the property.</li>
 * <li>{@code after&lt;PropertyName&gt;} - Called after the property is presented and validated in the UI. This can be
 * used to update the properties state to consider the changed in this property.</li>
 * <li>{@code validate&lt;PropertyName&gt;} - Called to validate the property value that has been entered in the UI.
 * This will return a {@link ValidationResult} object with any error information.</li>
 * <li>{@code beforeForm&lt;FormName&gt;} - Called before the form is displayed.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * <b>WARNING</b> - A property shall be created as instance field before the constructor is called so that this abstract
 * constructor can attach i18n translator to the properties. If you want to create the property later you'll have to
 * call {@link SchemaElement#setI18nMessageFormater(I18nMessages)} manually.
